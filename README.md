# RESTful API recipes
## Introduction
Short collection of basic steps of a RESTful API implementation in Node.js with generic components named accordingly.

## Samples
- **Plain Response** - Will answer every request with a standard response
- **Basic Routing** - Will answer requests to the implemented resources accordingly, with a explicit message
- **Basic Routing - Logging, Errors, Nodemon** - Same as the above, but with implemented logging, error handling and nodemon
- **Body Parsing - CORS** - Similar with the above, with parsed requests and disabled CORS
- **MongoDB Operations** - Functional basic MongoDB API

## Usage
Launch any of the variants with the following command: 
```
nodejs server.py
```
Launch any of the variants, except the first two, with the following command, to automatically restart the server on save:
```
npm start
```
